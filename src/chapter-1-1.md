Through this book, we aim to provide logistics companies, researchers, and practitioners with a better understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of using chatbots and AI in shipping logistics management. We also provide case studies and real-world examples from the industry to illustrate the use of chatbots and AI, and offer practical suggestions for implementing them effectively.
